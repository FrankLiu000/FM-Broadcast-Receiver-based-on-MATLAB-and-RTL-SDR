# FM-Broadcast-Receiver-based-on-MATLAB-and-RTL-SDR
An FM radio developed using MATLAB and RTL-SDR, adapted and downsized from MATLAB's built-in 'FMReceiverExample'.

List of files:

1. FMReceiver_Exported.m: FM broadcast receiver with a GUI, developed using MATLAB App Designer;
2. FMReceiver_Prototype.m: FM broadcast receiver without a GUI, and with a fixed center frequency of 92.100MHz.

Either code could run individually. :D
